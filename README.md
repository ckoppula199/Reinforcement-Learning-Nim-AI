# Reinforcement-Learning-Nim-AI

Simple AI trained using epsilon-greedy Q-learning algorithm.

Completed as part of Harvard's CS50 Intro to AI course.
Note: I was responsible for writing the get_q_value(), update_q_value, best_future_reward, choose_action and choose_action_helper methods in the nim.py file. The rest of the code is provided by Harvard CS50 and is not my own work.

To run the script execute python play.py in the command line.
